## Mockups Lab

For this we would like you to code the attached mockups using Twitter Bootstrap.

## Getting Started

1. For each mockup, create a new HTML page and include Twitter Bootstrap in your head tag.
2. Since you are not running your code on a server, make sure that you include http:// in all of your bootstrap links.
3. Be sure to check your networks tab to ensure that Bootstrap is included and working.
4. Now you're ready to start coding!
5. Try to use as little external CSS as possible, you should be able to do almost everything using Bootstrap classes. Challenge yourself to write as little CSS as possible.
6. Use http://lorempixel.com if you need a placeholder for images.
1. When you are finished or even if you do not get done in time, make sure to push your code to github.
